# 🎓 Student Performance Dashboard
A complete data analysis and storytelling project exploring academic performance among students using SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Power BI.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze how factors such as **gender**, **parental education**, **lunch type**, and **test preparation** impact student scores in **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- `MySQL` – Data storage and SQL queries for aggregation
- `Jupyter Notebook` – SQL queries execution, Pandas data handling, EDA
- `Python Libraries:` Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MySQL Connector
- `Power BI` – Dashboard design, KPIs, visuals, storytelling
- `DAX` – for calculated measures and performance categorization

## 🧪 Jupyter Notebook

- Used to connect to MySQL database
- Ran SELECT, GROUP BY, and CASE statements
- Exported clean and aggregated data to be visualized in Power BI
- Also includes basic summary statistics and gender-based analysis

📁 Notebook file: `StudentPerformance_Analysis.ipynb`

## ❓ Key Questions
- Who performs better – male or female students?
- Does lunch or test preparation affect performance?
- Which group of parental education leads to better scores?
- What is the overall performance distribution?

## 📊 Insights
- **Female students** excel in **reading** and **writing**  
- **Male students** outperform in **math**  
- Students with **standard lunch** perform better than those with free/reduced lunch  
- Students whose parents have **Master's degrees** have the highest average scores  
- Group E has the highest scores across all subjects

## 📖 Narrative
This project highlights how social and academic factors influence student outcomes. The storytelling component reflects not only the numbers but also potential reasons behind these trends, encouraging targeted solutions.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Tailor teaching styles by gender (story-based math for girls, challenge-based reading for boys)
- Increase support for students with less parental education
- Provide resources to underperforming ethnic groups
- Focus on removing exam pressure and building empathy-driven education
